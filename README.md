# NearRealTimeGNSSIR

NearRealTimeGNSSIR is an open-source project dedicated to the development of a Near Real-Time GNSS Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) software. This tool aims to utilize the potential of GNSS-IR technology to extract critical environmental parameters, such as sea level, snow depth, soil moisture, in near real time. By using GNSS signal-to-noise ratio data, we aim to facilitate efficient and timely environmental monitoring, supporting scientific research and practical applications.

## Features

- Extraction of environmental parameters (e.g., sea level, snow depth, soil moisture) from GNSS signal-to-noise ratio data.
- Near real-time data processing for accurate and near real-time results. (Integration with BKG Ntrip Client (BNC) for real-time data retrieval in the initial stages. Future versions may embed this functionality directly within the software.)
- Open-source contributions welcome to expand capabilities and improve performance.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the GNSS-IR community! Whether you're interested in improving existing features, adding new functionality, or helping with documentation, your support is invaluable. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues to discuss ideas.
