# NearRealTimeGNSSIR
This repository aims to develop Near Real-Time GNSS Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) software. The goal is to extract environmental parameters, like sea level, snow depth, and soil moisture, from GNSS signal-to-noise ratio data in near real time, enabling efficient and timely environmental monitoring.
